This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in ActionScript related to how it handles sparse arrays.  Accessing an element in a sparse array that hasn't been explicitly assigned a value will result in a null value, potentially leading to a null pointer exception.  The `bug.as` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.as` provides a solution using checks before access.
